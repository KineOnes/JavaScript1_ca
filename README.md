You will need to make two calls to this API:

to fetch an array of results
to fetch a single result using an id, name, or other property
You will need to read the APIâ€™s documentation to see what URLs are available, if they require a key to be sent in the header, and any other configuration they might need.

There are many free APIs discoverable by a Google search.
